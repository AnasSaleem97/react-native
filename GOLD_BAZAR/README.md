# 🏆 GoldDesk: Professional Gold Laboratory OS

## 🚨 The Industry Problem: The "Legacy Desk" Trap

Currently, the local gold testing industry is paralyzed by decade-old, offline legacy software. Jewelers are tied to their desks, unable to perform high-stakes testing or quote live pricing away from a fixed terminal. Furthermore, manually calculating gold purity using fluid physics and converting results into traditional market units (**Tola/Masha/Ratti**) is prone to human error—where a tiny decimal mistake can cost thousands.

## 💡 The Solution: A Unified Cloud-Connected Ecosystem

**GoldDesk (Gold Bazar)** is a disruptive, cross-platform laboratory suite that untethers jewelers from their desks. By introducing a **Mobile-First Revolution** via React Native, jewelers can perform lab-grade tests and share thermal-print receipts instantly from their phones. The **Electron Desktop** companion provides a robust, modernized terminal experience, all synced via a high-performance cloud architecture.

## 🖥️ System Architecture & Workflow

## ✨ Key Features & Technical Scope

### 🧪 Lab-Grade Physics Engine

* **Precision Algorithms**: Implementation of Archimedes' Principle tuned to localized density standards (19.29g/cm³) for exact Karat and purity determination.
* **Localized Math**: Custom logic to perfectly convert decimal grams into **Tola/Masha/Ratti** formats, including complex "borrowing" math for negative impurity (Kaat) scenarios.

### 📱 Mobile-First Freedom (React Native)

* **On-the-Go Testing**: Perform complex lab tests and generate instant PDF reports from iOS or Android devices.
* **Instant Receipts**: Direct integration for mobile thermal printing and digital sharing with clients.

### 🖥️ High-Performance Desktop (Electron)

* **Terminal Experience**: A modernized, robust desktop environment for front-counter operations.
* **Real-time Sync**: Bi-directional data synchronization between shop terminals and mobile devices.

### 📊 Market Intelligence & Security

* **Live Market Terminal**: A real-time **OS (Ounce Spot) Price** board for Gold and Silver, utilizing custom cloud-caching to avoid API rate limits.
* **Enterprise Security**: Strict **Device Fingerprinting** (limited to 2 devices per license) and remote session revocation via a Firebase admin portal.
